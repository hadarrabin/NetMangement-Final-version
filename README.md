Manual for simple client.
you will need only the client folder, so it is recommended to download this folder only.
after you have download the folder, you should open the Config.ini file.
In this file in the right place please write the SERVER COMPUTER IP.
in the second place please write the size you want by this order:
1-bytes
2-kilobytes
3-megabytes
4-gigabytes
and for the last you should configure the CPU LIMIT you want, by placing a number between 1-99.

After you have done the above you can open the Client.py script or run it in any form you want.
Here are a few ways in case you are not familier with any:
the easiest way is to open the command line and write the following:
1- cd C:\python27 press enter
2- python full\path\to\file\Client.py press enter
another way is to open the Client.py with any python compitable IDE and run the programm.

Before you want to start running the script, make sure you have installed python27 32 bit, compitable version of Crypto package, and pywin32 package.
